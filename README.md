# React-POC

This is just test code to get my feet wet with React. 

I created a very stripped down version of our Modern Sales Site SRP.

<b>Notes:</b>
- The properties are coming from a fake API I set up
- Conducting a search will not work, but if you enter text into the search input box and click the "Search" button it will update the location in the "0 listings in and around" text
- The Privacy Policy link in the footer will go to our static Privacy Policy page
